# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Abbegail, but most people call me Abby. I'm a first year Interactive Design student at SAIT, with a major in Web Design and Development!

This semester, I hope to:
1. Refine my HTML and CSS coding skills
2. Learn new things about visual design
3. Become familiar with the ins and outs of Adobe Creative Cloud, Github, Visual Studio Code, and other applications I will need to know for web development!
