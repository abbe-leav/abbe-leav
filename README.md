# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Abbegail, but most people call me Abby. I'm a first year Interactive Design student at SAIT, with a major in **Web Design and Development!**

I have also taken some SAIT classes already, including a Web Development course and a User Experience and Design course. I took a few computer science courses in high school as well.

In the coming semesters, I hope to:
1. Refine my HTML and CSS coding skills
2. Learn new things about visual design
3. Become familiar with the ins and outs of Adobe Creative Cloud, Github, Visual Studio Code, and other applications I will need to know for web development!

I have some coding and Git experience already, but not much, so *hopefully* soon there will be more repositories on my profile! I am looking forward to all the learning and new experiences ahead of me! ðŸ˜Š
